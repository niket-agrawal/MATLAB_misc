### Bulk greyscale all images inside any particular directory

This code is mainly written to convert specific extension file type/s (.jpg in this case) inside any specific folder. The folder path must taken care of before using this code.

## How to Run -
- this is for all `.jpg` images inside `images/`
- for any other directory, please change this as needed 

**Example of input** : Input folder is `images/`

**Output is** : All `*.jpg` images will be greyscaled, and renamed as `*_bnw.jpg`

**WARNING** : please remove all `*_bnw.jpg` images from the folder before running this code, otherwise it might show the error `MAP must be a m x 3 array.`
